This is the critbit binary tree part of the <https://github.com/openbook-dex/openbook-v2> codebase which is the most complex part and so to experiment it directly without setting up anchor and stuffs you can use this repo.  

Here's my explanation on how the limits orders are stored <https://pvnotpv.github.io/posts/openbook> and how it works.

You need to set rust to 1.70 for it to work.

```bash
rustup override set 1.70
rustup default 1.70
```
